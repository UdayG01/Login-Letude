# 🖥️ Signup Project

## 🚩 Introduction
* In this directory, I'll be pushing my final project for the training program at Letude.
### 🕸️ ReactJS
* This assignment introduced me to the renowned ReactJS framework for Web Development, and was enough to justify that why ReactJS has distinguished itself. 
* Why React?:
  - It allows you to build composable custom components, enabling better better readability and flexibilty of code.
  - It provides itself as a declarative language, that is, provides a vast base for pre-written functionalities, giving a convinient environment to the developer.
  - It introduces JSX, giving an easy way to incorporate html templates in javascript.
  - It is maintained by quality developers at Facebook
  - And many more...
### 📜 My Assignment
* For my task, I was alloted a front-end of a signup page (and login page) using ReactJS.

## 📂 In the Repo
* Here, you'll find to folders:
  - public- containing the index.html file receiving the code from the js files and eventually running it to the browser.
  - src - this composes all the files defining the front-end of the webpage, like index.js, App.js, components directory.
  - I'll also be uploading the screen captures of the front-end I developed.
